# Mission-to-Mars
Our client is a huge fan space, especially Mars. In order to learn as much as she can, and possibly earn a job at Nasa, they have asked us to create an app to scrape various websites to get updated news on the planet. In order to do that, we have created code, so with a click of a button, they can get all the up to date news.
